# Jerry_VoiceAssistant

JERRY is different from other traditional voice assistants in terms that it is specific to desktop and user does not need to make account to use this, it does not require any internet connection while getting the instructions to perform any specific task. The IDE used in this project is PyCharm. All the python files were created in PyCharm and all the necessary packages were easily installable in this IDE. For this project following modules and libraries were used i.e. pyttsx3, Speech Recognition, Datetime, Wikipedia, Smtplib, pywhatkit, pyjokes, pyPDF2, pyautogui, pyQt etc. I have created a live GUI for interacting with the JERRY as it gives a design and interesting look while having the conversation. 

With the advancement JERRY can perform any task with same effectiveness or can say more effectively than us. By making this project, I realized that the concept of AI in every field is decreasing human effort and saving time. Functionalities of this project include, it can send emails, it can read PDF, it can send text on WhatsApp, it can open command prompt, your favourite IDE, notepad etc., it can play music, It can do Wikipedia searches for you, it can opwebsites like Google, YouTube, etc., in a web browser, it can give weather forecast, it can give desktop reminders of your choice. it can have some basic 
conversation.This project chronicles the development of JERRY, a custom voice assistant designed to streamline daily tasks and enhance user experience within the desktop environment. JERRY stands out 
from conventional voice assistants in several key aspects:

• Desktop-Centric Focus: Unlike its counterparts designed for smart speakers and mobile devices, JERRY operates exclusively on desktops, offering a tailored set of functionalities for computer-based workflows.

• Offline Functionality: JERRY empowers users with voice-activated features without the need for an internet connection. This eliminates dependence on network availability and ensures seamless operation even in offline environments.

• Account-Free Design: JERRY prioritizes user privacy by removing the requirement for account creation. This eliminates the need for login credentials and simplifies the user experience
